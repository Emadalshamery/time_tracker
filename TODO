* Feature: Up-vote a task (add a mention)
* Refactor start, stop, resume, upvote so that they're using the same
  code to find task by name and number
* Sort lists by mention
* stop -> finish/end/complete, start -> begin (change error messages too)
* Feature: Move a task up or down on the list
* Modify add task (and auto-adding before starting) to search before
  adding a new one, and suggest pre-existing tasks to up-vote instead
* Feature: Tagging
  * Might need to tweak listings again
* Integrate with Pivotal
  * Is there already a command-line version of Pivotal we can borrow
    code from?
* Feature: Comments on tasks
* Feature: 'show' command (list everything about a task - tags, comments, etc.)
* Add colors to listings
* Command-line UI, so that we can "stick" the prompt for commands at the
  top of the terminal window and then if the user runs, say, `tt list`
  and the list is really long, the user doesn't lose their place

* Feature: Pause (put on hold, hold, suspend) a task manually?
* Since MongoDB's natural sort order is not often desirable, are there
  other cases in which we aren't ordering by something explicit?
  Or is there a way to hack MM to sort by created_at by default?
* List today's tasks by ended_at asc too?
