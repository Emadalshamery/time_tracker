* Make an 'add task' command
  * Default state for a task is now 'created' (or 'pending')
  * Make it possible to add a task with the same name as a pre-existing
    task, only if said task is stopped
* Starting a non-existing task auto-creates it, but prompt first
* Don't allow a stopped or paused task to be started
* All task listings should not include 'created' tasks

* How do we handle {stop|resume} "some task" ? Maybe only look
  for tasks corresponding to the action you want to take... e.g. if
  I start a named task, only look within tasks that aren't running
  yet, or else bail with helpful text; if I stop a named task, only
  look within tasks that are running

* Make an 'add project' command
  * Switching to a non-existent project auto-creates it, but prompt first

* Up-vote a task (add a mention)
* Modify add task (and auto-adding before starting) to search before
  adding a new one, and suggest pre-existing tasks to up-vote instead
* Tagging
  * Might need to tweak listings again
* Integrate with Pivotal
  * Is there already a command-line version of Pivotal we can borrow
    code from?

* Don't use Thor anymore, I think we can just hand-roll our own dispatcher
* Add ability to pause a task manually?
* Add colors to listings
* Pipe listings to less?
* List today's tasks by ended_at asc too?
