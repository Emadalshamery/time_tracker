* Resuming a task and finding matching tasks in other projects -
  ensure that we exclude created tasks
* Since MongoDB's natural sort order is not often desirable, are there
  other cases in which we aren't ordering by something explicit?
  Or is there a way to hack MM to sort by created_at by default?

* Make an 'add project' command
  * Switching to a non-existent project auto-creates it, but prompt first

* Up-vote a task (add a mention)
* Modify add task (and auto-adding before starting) to search before
  adding a new one, and suggest pre-existing tasks to up-vote instead
* Tagging
  * Might need to tweak listings again
* Integrate with Pivotal
  * Is there already a command-line version of Pivotal we can borrow
    code from?

* Comments on tasks
* 'show' command (list everything about a task - tags, comments, etc.)

* Don't use Thor anymore, I think we can just hand-roll our own dispatcher
  * or try out Optitron...
* Add ability to pause a task manually?
* Add colors to listings
* Pipe listings to less?
* List today's tasks by ended_at asc too?
